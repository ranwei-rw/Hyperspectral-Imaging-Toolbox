%% Syntax
%     Q = mix_spectra(Abundances, Indexes, Endmembers)

%% Description
%
% Mix the spectra given a set of abundances, indexes and endmembers. 
% This is, effectively, the inverse operation to unmixing.
%
%% Inputs:
%
%     Abundances:   Matrix containign the abundance coefficients per endmember. This is a 
%                   cols x rows x endmembers matrix, where the output matrix Q is cols x rows x bands.
%     Indexes:      Matrix containing the indexes for the endmembers.
%     Endmembers:   Matrix whose rows are indexed to the endmembers and columns to the 
%                   wavelength, i.e. Endmember(i,:) contains the ith endmember spectrum
%     numMaterials:    Number of materials used for the recovery of the spectra. If 
%                   this is not provided, the size of 3rd dimension of the abundance matrix is used.
%     normalise:    If normalise is unity, the output spectra is normalised accordingly, 
%                    i.e. norm(Q(i,i),3) is equivalent to 1. The default is 1.
% 
%% Outputs:
%    Q: Matrix of mixed spectra
