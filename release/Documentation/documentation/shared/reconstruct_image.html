%% Reconstruct an FLA (flat) data structure from an HSZ

%% Syntax:
%     I=reconstruct_image(HSZ);
% 
%% Description:
%     Recover a hyperspectral image structure (the image cube and the header) 
%     from an HSZ structure which can be imported from HSZ files by calling 
%     function HSZread 
% 
%% Input:
%     HSZ: HSZ structure
%     
%% Output:
%     I: Structure containing the image cube (I.I) and the corresponding header (I.HDR).
